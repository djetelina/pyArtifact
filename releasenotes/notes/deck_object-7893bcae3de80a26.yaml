prelude: >
  A simple Deck wrapper has been designed and is ready to be tested :)
features:
  - :py:class:`pyartifact.Deck` has been 'done' (still prototype version). To use it, all sets have to be loaded.
  - |
    :py:class:`pyartifact.deck.Overview` has been added as a property of the deck.
    It offers a quick glance over the contents of the deck
  - |
    :py:class:`pyartifact.filtering.CardFilter` now has a `sub_type` filter
    (no `sub_type_in` and `sub_type_not_in` variants just yet)
  - |
    :py:class:`pyartifact.filtering.CardFilter` now works internally with list of cards
    instead of a set, to be able to filter through deck contents etc.
fixes:
  - |
    :py:func:`pyartifact.decode_deck_string` and :py:func:`pyartifact.encode_deck` have been refactored
    and very well docummented and commented. It should now be fairly easy to understand!

    Mypy is an a** and we won't be working with him again. Killer of productivity that only complicated code.
    His paws might still be seen here and there, if you see a weird piece of code that could be simplified
    if it didn't require mypy to pass, feel free to point it out.
    (Typing is still useful and this library should stay pycharm compatible, no warnings raised there!)
  - Tons of docstrings were added in preparation for sphinx autodoc
